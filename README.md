# Twitter Clone
A full-stack clone of twitter built with React, Redux, MongoDB with the exact styling and functionality of Twitter as of August 2018. Currently only completed the desktop styling and functionality, however mobile styling may be completed at a later date.

## Installation
To access the application, you can use [this](https://react-twitter-clone.herokuapp.com/) link. It is currently hosted on heroku's free hosting plan while it's being developed, so it may take a little bit of time to load for the first time. Alternatively, you can fork the repository and install it using `npm install`, and running `npm run dev` inside the api directory to access the application through the webpack dev-server (`cd api`, followed by `npm run dev` from the root directory.)
